# Scripts

This is a very specific repo where you'll find all sorts of wonky scripts! These are very use case specific scripts that if you need you can use them
You can always modify them to according to your needs, since they have been built with plenty fail safe measures and protections for idiots and dum dums (that you are)

Also I've no idea on what all I've in here. So go ahead and enjoy your time, I have some fun README's to tingle your funny bone
